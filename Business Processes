-> What is a business process
                         A business process is an organized set of activities and decisions,
                        aimed at creating an output that is actually required by a customer,
                                   to which she attributes a well-defined value

The business processes:
    –   Represent how work is actually accomplished within firms
    –   Link the activities of an organization to the requirements of its customers
    –   Embed, in their execution, the organizational strategy, creating opportunities to produce a competitive advantage
    –   Generally are cross-functional and horizontal
    –   Can extend beyond corporate boundaries
    –   Describe what is outside the traditional hierarchic structures
    –   “Force” employees to collaborate
                                                   Function A      Function B      Function C


                                 Customer                                                           Customer
                                 needs                                                              satisfaction
                                 INPUT                                                              OUTPUT
                                 (e.g. order)                                                       (e.g.
                                                                                                    delivered
                                                                                                    product)
->Example of a process: a description
• The order fulfillment process is carried out by a seller’s organization which includes two
  departments: the sales department and the warehouse & distribution department.

• The purchase order received by warehouse & distribution is checked against the stock. This
  operation is carried out automatically by the ERP system of warehouse & distribution, which
  queries the warehouse database.

• If the product is in stock, it is retrieved from the warehouse before sales confirm the order.
  Next sales emit an invoice and wait for the payment, while the product is shipped from
  within warehouse & distribution. The process completes with the order archival in the sales
  department.

• If the product is not in stock, the ERP system within warehouse & distribution checks the
  raw materials availability by accessing the suppliers catalog. Once the raw materials have
  been obtained the warehouse & distribution depart- ment takes care of manufacturing the
  product. The process completes with the purchase order being confirmed and archived by
  the sales department.
  

->Why processes matter

• Customer centrality
• Performance improvement
• Co-creation of value

->Process orientation vs. Business Process Managegement (BPM)

• Process orientation: organizational approach that emphasizes business processes
  with respect to hierarchical structures, with a strong emphasis on results and
  customer satisfaction

• Basic assumptions: organizations do not create value and profits through
  organizational units but through business processes

• Business Process Management: systematic and structured approach to analyze,
  manage, control and improve business processes over time with the aim of
  integrating activities and improving the overall performance of products and services

->Key elements of a business process
•   Output:
     -    Defined starting from the customer needs
     -    Both physical as well as informa7onal

•   Input:
     -     Physical or informational factors from outside or from other processes
     -     They are necessary to the development of the process (transformation of the inputs)

•   Controls: data and information that provides rules, procedures to be followed

•   Phases:
     -     Sets of activities and decisions that, interacting among each other, enable to achieve the outputs
     -     Heterogeneous nature: e.g. transformation, delivery, information elaboration, decisions, etc.

•   Interdependences:
     -    Logical and priority links among phases, activities and decisions
     -    They are sequential, mutual or generic
          

•   Events: situations that affect the process ﬂow

•   Resources:
     -    Human competences
     -    Technologies (machine tools, plans, information systems, SW, automatic procedures)

•   Management methods: basic logics through which coordinate activities, make decisions and check the process progress

->Process classification
                 Government processes: provides tools to support decision making
                 (their “customers” are managers and stakeholders)


                 Operational support processes: produce services and info
                 for the business deployment (they have internal customers)

                                Management control
                                   HR management
                               Technology development
                                    Procurement


                    INBOUND LOGISTICS, OPERATIONS, OUTBOUND LOGISTICS, MARKETING SALES, SERVICES
					
                 Primary processes: directly create value for the external customers

                         Request          Output



         Requires:
         – Treat the downstream function as an external customer
         – Work for the client and not for the boss
         – Flexibility and response speed
         – Extend the logic upstream and downstream (customer-supplier partnership)

   – Deployment of objectives
   – Activation of customer-supplier chains
   
• Levers:
   – Interface measurement (e.g. SLA, transfer prices)
   – Application of partnership logics (joint implementation of the transaction, process management,
     exchange of know-how)

   – Information production within processes
   – Outsourcing of support processes


• Objectives/Benefits:
   – Avoid "estrangement" and "self-referentiality" of support processes
   – Improve the timeliness of the support
   
->3. Process ownership

• Background logic/key elements:
  Supervision and support of the integration between "traditional" processes and organizational structures

       • Job enlargement: multiple tasks in the same position
       • Job enrichment: more autonomy and decision-making power
       • Working groups: shared responsibility for process results
   – Delegation of decision-making:
       •   Responsibility for process performance
       •   Substantial as well as formal delegation (autonomy, decision levers)
       •   Need for training
       •   Delegation + increase in skills = staff empowerment


• Objectives/Benefits:
   – Reduce the need for integration/coordination along the business process
   – Employees’ involvement
   
->5. Process documentation

->7. Process flow optimization

• Background logic/key elements:
  Designing the flow and the sequence of activities from a business process perspective


• Levers:
   –   Elimination of redundant activities that do not add value
   –   Streamlining of process flow (reduced feedback loops)
   –   Parallelization or activities overlapping to reduce process leadtime
   –   Rationalization of control activities (e.g. from complete to sample-based)


• Objectives/Benefits:
   – Create value for the end customer of the process
   – Make the process effective and efficient

->8. Decoupling point

• Background logic/key elements:
  Balance response speed and personalization


• Levers:
   –   Detection of the decoupling point
   –   Redesign of product/service architecture
   –   Use of standard modules (e.g. flatbed vehicles of segment B)
   –   Postponement (standardization of upstream activities and customization of downstream ones)


• Objectives/Benefits:
   – Create value for process customer
   – Make the process effective and efficient

->The pivotal role of Information and Communication Technologies

•   Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a pivotal role in configuring process-
    oriented organizations
     – Improved coordination
     – Facilitation of control
     – Dissemination of knowledge

•   Attention: ICTs must not guide process redesign, but follow and support it!

•   Two families of applications:
     – Support for process modeling and management (Business Process Management Systems - BPMS)
     – Support to process execution and integration (Enterprise Systems - ES)
