ORGANIZATION THEORY AND DESIGN

Key problems in organizational design

• Specialization: need to divide activities required to obtain a
  specific output between different people and organisational
  units

• Coordination: need to guarantee coherence and results of the
  activities when specialisation increases

• Two levels:
   – Individuals
   – Organizational units

Organization: a definition

- Social entity

- Driven by clear objectives

- Designed as a system of deliberately structured and coordinated activities

- Which interacts with the external environment



                   ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT SO MUCH MADE BY BUILDINGS
                  OR POLICIES / PROCEDURES BUT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE
                          PEOPLE AND THE RELATIVE RELATIONSHIPS
Why organizations matter

- They bring together resources to achieve the desired goals and results

- They produce goods and services efficiently

- They facilitate innovation

- They use modern production technologies

- They adapt to the changing environment and influence it

- They create value for shareholders, customers and employees

- They combine the current challenges of motivation, ethics and diversity
  management with the need for greater coordination of human resources
How can you tell if an organization is not effective?


• Low motivation and morale

• Delayed or low-quality decision making

• Conflicts and lack of coordination

• Slow adaptation to changing circumstances

• Rising costs

Key elements for an effective organization

- Organizational competences
- Processes
- Structure
- Organizational behaviours                    
- Management of HR

The contingent approach to organizational design
                                    Organizational design
       the organization is modeled as an artificial system, identifying levers, environmental
       and contextual variables and performances to "design" or redesign the organization

                                   Contingent approach:
      There is no absolute better choice but rather it is possible to select a limited number
       of possibilities from which choosing based on criteria of internal (between decision
       variables) and external (with environmental and contextual variables) consistency

The main organizational variables

•   Organizational structure (coordination and division of labor)
     – Design and integration of organizational units (macro-structure)
     – Assignment to individuals of jobs/tasks/roles (micro-structure)
                                                                            

•   Management systems (stimuli for behavioral adaptation)                 
     – Evaluation and incentive systems
     – Planning and control systems
     – Information and communication systems

                                                                            
•   Organizational power (relationships of mutual influence)              
     – Centralization and decision-making decentralization
     – Direction style
     – Conflict management
	 
Perspective: interpretation -> Support to decision making

Design of the organizational structure

     Set of relatively stable elements related to the roles that express the basic criteria with which the
                     division of labor and coordination are implemented within a company




• Design of the organizational structure at MICRO level:
   – Division of work and coordination between individuals within groups/units
   – Typical problems faced: specialization, qualification, motivation, empowerment



• Design of the organizational structure at MACRO level:
   – Division of work and coordination among groups/units in the organization
   – Typical problems faced: hierarchical levels and "span of control", criteria for aggregating
     positions, systems for coordinating units

Design of the organizational structure at micro level
                 DESIGN AND ASSIGNMENT OF TASKS, JOBS AND ROLES

Key concepts


• Task: set of necessarily linked activities/operations given the used capacity and technique


• Job: set of tasks that can be assigned to a position (that can be covered by an individual)


• Role: set of behavioral expectations that the organization has in relation to an individual
  assigned to a position
  
Analysis and design of tasks
Definition for each position of:

• What to do: elementary jobs that form the task and degree of
  discretion (autonomy in programming and controlling results)
  -> horizontal and vertical specialization

• How doing it: define standards and rules for the realization of the assigned tasks
  -> formalization

• With which skills: define which knowledge, skills and
  values must have the person who performs the tasks
  -> selection, training e indoctrination
  
Horizontal specialization
         Breakdown of the elementary activities necessary for the realization of a certain output

• Factors driving towards horizontal specialization:
    –   Improve of dexterity and learning economies
    –   Saving in time lost in switching tasks
    –   Specialized methods and technologies
    –   Less need of training and qualified resources
    –   Better use of individual skills


• Issues associate to excessive horizontal specialization
    – Need for coordination (overhead)
    – Problem of balancing resources’ saturation
    – Repetitiveness, alienation
	
Seacrh for a tradeoff between specialization advantages and coordination costs

Vertical specialization

              Separation among pure execution from programming and control activities

• Factors driving towards vertical specialization:
    – Consequence of horizontal specialization: workers’ narrowed perspective
      makes difficult for them to relate their work to that of others
    – Possibility to hire less qualified workers
    – Better use of highly qualified workers and control and planning skills


• Issues associate to excessive vertical specialization:
    – Coordination problems
    – Demotivation, alienation
    – Insufficient contribution to improvement and innovation
	
Joint effects of vertical and horizontal specialization


                                 HORIZONTAL SPECIALIZATION
                                  HIGH        |     LOW

                      HIGH  |  Non- qualified |  Low and middle
                                 tasks           managers
	   VERTICAL
 SPECIALIZATION
                      LOW   |	Professional. |   High-level
                                  tasks           managers

Job redesign

•    Pressures towards job redesign
      – Lack of motivation
      – Need for flexibility to market changes and customer requirements
      – Focus on quality and innovation


•    Redesign approaches:
      –   Job rotation: rotation of tasks among individuals to pursue less repetitiveness and rigidity
      –   Job enlargement: increasing the number of tasks assigned to a job
      –   Job enrichment: increasing the level of autonomy and discretional power of individual jobs
      –   Teamwork: merge “self containing tasks” and assign them to interdisciplinary autonomous groups
	  
Coordinating mechanisms at micro level

• Mutual adjustment: coordination between operators
• Direct supervision: coordination of operators done by managers
• Standardization (coordination given by analysts)   
    – Output (o goals)
    – Input (o competences)
    – Processes
	
Coordinating mechanisms’ cycle at micro-level

Mutual adjustment -> Specialization -> Direct supervision -> Complexity and growth -> Process Standardization -> Uncertainty and diversification -> Goal Standardization -> Turbolence -> Competence standardization -> Further Turbolence

Designing the organizational structure at macro level

         DESIGN OF ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS THROUGH THE DEFINITION OF
              HOW THEY WILL BE AGGREGATED AND/OR INTEGRATED



             Organizational unit: subset of positions/roles to which a set of
           tasks is assigned in a rather stable way; tasks should be interrelated
                 each other and sufficiently autonomous and measurables
                                            
             Organizational unit gives the possibility of assigning a unitary responsibility (accountability)
			 
Key decision for a proper organizational design at macro level

• Horizontal and vertical differentiation              Factors influencing the link between size, n°
   – Horizontal differentiation: the way tasks are     of hierarchical levels and span of control:
     grouped into organizational units                 • Tasks complexity and interrelatedness
   – Vertical differentiation: the way the hierarchy   • Horizontal differentiation
     of authority and reporting relationships are      • Decentralization of authority
     designed
                                                       • Standardization
                                                       • Use of IT systems
• Span of control: total number of
  subordinates a supervisor has

• Number of hierarchical levels


Centralized vs. decentralized organizations

CENTRALIZATION                            DECENTRALIZATION

•   Higher coordination                   •   Flexibility and responsiveness
•   Focus on company goals                •   Motivation of (middle) managers

BUT                                       BUT

•   Managers become bottlenecks           •   Lower control on decision making
•   Focus on operational decisions        •   Requires decision making skills throughout the
•   Distance from day-to-day problems         organization

Vertical/tall organizational structures   Flat organizational structures


McDonald’s change from centralized to (partially) decentralized structure

•   Traditional McDonald’s org structure:
     – Centralized authority, control
     – Standardized production
     – Formalization of all activities throughout the world

•   Challenges from the environment:
     – Changed consumer tastes and eating behaviors
     – Environmental consciousness
     – Increased competition

•   New strategic approach: flexibility in menus, decor, restaurant's formula, etc.

•   New organizational structure: Decentralized authority to regional managers was not enough

•   So:
     –    Decentralized authority to core operations
     –    Teams of food specialists
     –    New top management team
     –    Centralized control over quality

 Organizational structures

The perfect organizational structure does not exist.
There are organizational structures that are best suited to the company and the context in which it competes
                    
Organizational structures

• Simple (composed of founder and few people)
	-   Grouping criteria: –
	-   Strengths: flexibility, knowledge development, diffusion of norms and values
	-   Weaknesses: conflicts, decision-making bottle-necks
	-   Typical context: young and small companies
 
• Functional

	-   Grouping criteria: process or technique used, competence
	-   Strengths: allows economies of scale within functional departments; enables knowledge and skill development; facilitates peers supervision; enables development of competence-based norms and values
	-   Weaknesses: slow response time to environmental changes; hierarchy overload; poor horizontal coordination among departments; lack of innovation, limited awareness of organizational goals
	-   Typical context: companies with one or few products competing in rather stable industries

• Divisional

	-   Grouping criteria: product, customer, geographical area
	-   Strengths: market responsiveness, adaptation to differences in products, regions, clients, faster and decentralized decision-making
	-   Weaknesses: reduced economies of scale, poor coordination across product lines, lack of in-depth competence and technical specialization
	-   Typical context: large organizations with several products in dynamic and unstable industries

• Hybrid

	-   Grouping criteria: both functional and divisional criteria
	-   Strengths: achieves coordination necessary to meet multiple goals; flexible sharing of human resources across units; provides opportunity for both functional and market skill development
	-   Weaknesses: causes participants to experience dual authority, which can be frustrating and confusing; participants need good interpersonal skills and extensive training; is time consuming; involves frequent meetings and conflict resolution sessions; requires great effort to maintain power balance
	-   Typical context: complex industries and unstable environments; best in large-sized organizations with multiple products
